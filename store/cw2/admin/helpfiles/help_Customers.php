<h2>Customer Page Help</h2>
<h3>Customer Search / Search Results </h3>
<p> This page allows you to search for customers by the first letter in their last name, by Zip Code and by Order number. Both the Zip Search and the Order number searches are &quot;fuzzy&quot; searches, meaning that you can type in the first few numbers and the search will bring back records that start with the data you entered. The more data you enter the narrower the search will be.</p>
<h3>Returned Results</h3>
<p>The results returned are the closest matches to the search data you entered sorted alphabetically and displayed in a table format. The links available are a link to the <a href="<?php echo($cartweaver->thisPage);?>?helpFileName=CustomerDetails.php">Customer Details</a> page and an email link that will launch your default email program with the customer's email address. </p>
