<h3>List Country Choices</h3>
<p> This page manages the countries that will be available on your web site and in the related admin pages. You can set the country code, name and the order in which they will appear. If there are no States associated with a country it can be deleted. If there are associated States you can Archive the country.</p>
<p>The &quot;View&quot; link near the top of the page allows you to toggle between viewing Archived and Active country records. When viewing the Archived records you have the ability to reactivate the country by clicking the reactivate icon. </p>
