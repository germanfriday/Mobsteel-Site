<h2>Secondary Categories Admin Help</h2>
<h3>Like subcategories, but more flexible</h3>
<p> Secondary categories act as subcategories, but they can be searched on directly without an associated category. A product can be related to an unlimited number of secondary categories.</p>
<h3>Powerful Search Solution </h3>
<p>The real power in this is the flexibility with which products can be searched for. For example, you can narrow or refine a search using secondary categories by searching for Clothing (category) / Men's (secondary category). In this way the secondary category acts like a traditional subcategory. Because there is no direct relationship between categories and secondary categories, you can easily widen your search by searching for &quot;Men's&quot; (secondary category only) This will return results of all products with a relationship to the Men's secondary category, regardless of what category they are in.</p>
