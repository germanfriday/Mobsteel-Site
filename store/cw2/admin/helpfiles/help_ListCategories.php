<h2>Categories Admin Help</h2>
<h3>Administer Product Categories </h3>
<p> Products are categorized and identified by as many as four layers of search criteria: product, category, secondary category and keywords. The larger number of products you carry, the more search options you should offer to help your customer narrow down what he/she is looking for. </p>
<p>You may add an unlimited number of categories or delete/archive existing categories. This list determines the choices available to the customer when searching your site, and the choices you have when assigning a category to a product. </p>
<p>Categories are your &quot;top level&quot; search filter and for that reason each product can only be associated with one category. If you have products that seem to fit in more that one category, take time to rethink how you have categorized them. A category should be broad enough to cover everything associated with it. Department stores are a good example of this, for example: housewares, clothing, jewelry and so forth. </p>
<h3>Note: Archiving</h3>
<p>Categories that are associated with products can not be deleted. Doing so would make the products in that category unavailable. If you want to no longer use one of these categories you can &quot;archive&quot; it, which will remove it from view on the web and in the Product Admin area. </p>
