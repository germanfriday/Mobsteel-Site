<h2>Shipping Methods Admin Help</h2>
<h3>Shipping Methods and Base Shipping Cost </h3>
<p> Here we set shipping methods that are available, the country they are associated with, and the <a href="<?php echo($cartweaver->thisPage);?>?helpFileName=ShipSettings.php">Base Rate</a> that is to be charged. You can also set the order in which the methods appear on the web. If no base rate is to be charged you can set the Base Rate to 0. </p>
<p>Methods that do not have orders associated with them may be deleted, otherwise they can be Archived. The &quot;View&quot; link near the top of the page allows you to view the archived records and reactivate them if you wish. </p>
