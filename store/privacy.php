      In order to serve you better, Mobsteel collects and stores your personal information when you: (i) sign up to be notified of special deals like discounts and exclusive offers; or (ii) enter a contest or promotion on our site.

Of course, to the extent that we would ever share any of that information with a consultant or service provider, we would only do so if we had your prior consent. We do use navigational information both in the aggregate and on an individual basis to understand how our visitors use Mobsteel so that we can make our site better. We do not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web.<br />
